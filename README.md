# zoomAppContext

When a user attempts to open your app from the Zoom client, Zoom sends an HTTP request to your appâ€™s Home URL and upon successfully completing the request, it renders the content of the Home URL in the Zoom client.

The request sent to your Home URL includes X-Zoom-App-Context header which is an AES-GCM encrypted JSON object with information about the user and the context in which the user opened the app.
